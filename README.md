Place Picker and Shortest Path
Overview
This Flutter application allows users to pick locations on a map and find the shortest path between two specified locations. It demonstrates the use of Flutter's flutter_map package for map rendering and marker management, and includes a feature to calculate and display the shortest path between two points using geocoding and pathfinding algorithms.

Features
Map Display: Shows a map with markers indicating the start and end locations.
Shortest Path Calculation: Computes and displays the shortest path between two locations.
Location Picker: Users can input locations and see them on the map.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Flutter SDK
Dart SDK
An IDE such as Android Studio or Visual Studio Code
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

sh
Copy code
flutter pub get
Usage
Run the application:

sh
Copy code
flutter run
Interacting with the App:

Enter the start and end locations in the respective text fields.
Click the search icon to find the shortest path.
The map will display markers for both locations and a polyline representing the shortest path.
Dependencies
flutter_map: A Flutter package for displaying maps.
latlong2: A package for handling geographic coordinates.
http: A package for making HTTP requests.
Example dependencies in pubspec.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_map: ^3.1.0
  latlong2: ^0.8.1
  http: ^0.15.0
Geocoding
The application uses the Nominatim API from OpenStreetMap for geocoding. Ensure you adhere to OpenStreetMap's usage policy.

Pathfinding
The shortest path is computed using a basic algorithm that calculates intermediate points along a straight line between the start and end coordinates.
